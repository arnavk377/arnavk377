#### Hey there! I'm Arnav, a 1st year Data Science Student at UC Irvine.  
Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnav-kanekar-a108b2279/)!

I'm interested in learning about general coding skills and more data focused skills.  
I have used Python and SQL for API design and have used Javascript and HTMl for basic Web design.  

Here is a [link](https://arnavk377.github.io/FirstFastPage/) to the website I used to log my work on during my *AP Computer Science Principles* class.
