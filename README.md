#### Hey there! I'm Arnav, a 2nd year Data Science Student at UC Irvine.

I have an interest in statistics and how they can be applied to find interesting anomalies.
Currently, I'm working on a football and data analysis blog, Hooked on Falcons. I collect and analyze football data to create reports for each game. Check it out [here](https://github.com/arnavk377/hookedonfalcons)!

I have experience working in Python, R, Javascript, C++ for a variety of tasks, from data cleaning to web development.
